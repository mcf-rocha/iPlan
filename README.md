# iPlan
An efficiency-oriented release planning tool based on tangible and intangible benefits for a portfolio of agile software development projects.

The tool is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for evaluating intangible benefits, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for selecting the most efficient release plan.

When the number of possible release plans is too high in terms of the time to enumerate all plans, the tool uses Stochastic Data Envelopment Analysis (Bootstrap DEA) to get confidence intervals for the efficiency from a sample of release plans.

This project is part of the PhD Thesis by Marcelo Carvalho Fernandes at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).
